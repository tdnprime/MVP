# Hello {{ucfirst( $creator->channel_name )}},

<p>Boxeon would like to partner with you.</p>

<p>We provide a platform for creators to sell subscription boxes to their fans. Fans can subscribe to receive these boxes via https://boxeon.com. They may subscribe to receive said boxes every month, two months, or three months.</p>

<p>In addition to providing this platform, we assist creators with curating their boxes. We have many suppliers with whom we work, so; we can acquire a range of products to satisfy any demographic. </p>

<p>We also handle the warehousing, shipping, and packaging of boxes. Therefore, creators will only be responsible for communicating with their viewers and driving them to subscribe.</p>

<p>In our partnership program, we give creators 86% of the profits made from the sale of their boxes.</p>

<p>Starting capital won't be an issue. We may offer the subscription box in pre-sales for the first four weeks and use pre-sales funds to acquire and ship initial inventory.</p>

<p>We're interested in partnering with you to offer your fans a subscription box of Ukraine-made daily essential products. Boxeon will donate part of its proceeds to Ukraine relief efforts.</p>

<p>Do let us know what you think.</p>

<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
Trevor Prime, CEO<br>
