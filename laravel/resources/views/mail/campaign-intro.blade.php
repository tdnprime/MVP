# Hello {{ucfirst( $creator->channel_name )}},
<br>

<p>Boxeon wants you in our affiliate program.</p>
<br>

<h2>What we do</h2>

<p>We provide a platform for creators to sell subscription boxes to their fans. Fans may subscribe to receive said boxes every month, two months, or three months.</p>

<p>In addition to providing this platform, we assist creators with curating their boxes. We have many suppliers with whom we work, so; we can acquire a range of products to satisfy any demographic. </p>

<p>We also handle the warehousing, shipping, and packaging of boxes. </p>

<h2>Your role</h2>
    
<p>You will be responsible for communicating with your viewers and driving them to subscribe. Both you and
    Boxeon will decide what goes into every box.
</p>

<h2>Let's talk money</h2>

<p>In our program, we give creators 86% (up to $50 per box) of the profits made from their boxes. This commission is recurring and will be paid
    to creators on a monthly basis for as long as the buyer remains subscribed.
</p>

<h2>A suggestion</h2>

<p>We suggest you offer your fans a subscription box of Ukraine-made daily essential products. Boxeon will donate part of its proceeds to Ukraine relief efforts.
    This will be great for your brand.
</p>
<h2>Next step</h2>
<p>We're hosting group meetings with creators via Google Meet to dicuss further. Our next meeting is Friday at 2pm EST. If interested, please
    let us know.
</p>

Sincerely,<br>
Trevor Prime, CEO<br>
