    # Hello {{ ucfirst($creator->channel_name) }},
    <br>
    <p>Boxeon would like to partner with you.</p>

    <p>Boxeon is a platform for creators to offer subscription boxes to their fans. Boxeon is like Patreon but for
        subscription boxes.</p>

    <p>You will receive 86% of the profits.</p>

    <p>If necessary, we will help with warehousing, packaging, and fulfillment.</p>

    <p>Starting capital won't be an issue. We may offer the subscription box in pre-sales for the first four weeks and use
        pre-sales funds to acquire and ship initial inventory.</p>

    <p>We suggest that the first set of boxes are offered in support of Ukraine relief efforts. We do have a product curator
        who is Ukrainian and she will be able to help curate a box of Ukrainian-made products.</p>

    <p>For more info, please check out https://boxeon.com/partner</p>

    <br><br>

    Sincerely,<br>
    Trevor Prime, CEO<br>
