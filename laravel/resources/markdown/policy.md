Boxeon privacy statement
Effective July 1, 2021

Overview
This privacy statement explains how and why Boxeon collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our website or use our service. Reading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.

“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.

“Boxeon” in this statement means Boxeon LLC. This privacy statement applies to the services offered by Boxeon.

Your privacy rights and choices
When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.

Understanding your rights
You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months. You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you. If you want to see or delete your personal data, via service@boxeon.com. We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights. If you are a California resident, learn more about how we have handled your Privacy Rights.

If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.

If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:

Contact us and request that we delete your information
Close your account
If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:

Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the Terms of Use or other contract you have with us
Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity
Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech
Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services
Comply with laws
Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data. For example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our Consumer Privacy Notice for more information about their rights under US federal law.

Understanding your choices
You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices:

Choose how we collect personal data
You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or third-party services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.

For example, creating an account with us requires your personal data. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.

Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data
If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.

You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Settings in your Boxeon account.

Choose how we communicate with you
Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.

You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.

You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.

The personal data we collect
We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or interact with our third-party services.

If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location. When you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law. We may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date.

Here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an account or use our services:

1. Information that identifies you, for example:

First and last name
Address
Phone number
Email
IP address
Information collected from cookies or other tracking technologies
2. Records and financial information, for example:

Our payment partners, such as card networks and payment processors
Financial institutions, such as banks
Credit bureaus
Service providers, such as companies that help us manage risk and fraud, deliver services to you, and market our services
If you have an account with Boxeon, we will associate information from all these sources with your account to improve your experience and for compliance and analytics purposes.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from people who are not allowed to use our sites and services, such as children under the age of 13. Contact us if you believe that we’ve mistakenly collected personal data from someone not allowed to use our services. We’ll delete it immediately, unless we’re legally required to keep it.

How we use tracking technologies like cookies
We or our third-party service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services. The information collected with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.

You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.

Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.

Why we collect personal data

We collect personal data for many reasons, including to improve your experience, and to run our business. Specific reasons why we collect your personal data include:

Run our sites and provide better services, for example to help you send or recieve money, make purchases, show you your account information, verify access to your account, and keep your account and payment information up to date.

Personalize your experience when you use our sites and services, as well as other third-party sites and services. In this case, we might use tracking technologies like cookies.

Contact you when you need us, such as answering a question you sent to our customer service team.
