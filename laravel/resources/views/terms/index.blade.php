            <h1 class='extra-large-font centered darkblue'>Boxeon Terms of Use</h1>
            <p>Effective July 1, 2021</p>

            <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS;
                IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.
            </p>

            <p>Welcome to boxeon.com. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our
                website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or
                concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at service@Boxeon.com</p>

            <p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Boxeon LLC (“Boxeon,” “we” and “us”).
                You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your using
                the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect
                while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the
                Privacy Policy and Copyright Dispute Policy.
            </p>
            <h2>Will these Terms ever change?</h2>
            <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.
                We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by
                placing a notice on the Boxeon website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.</p>

            <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no
                longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is
                effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>

            <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be
                effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>

            <h2>What about my privacy?</h2>
            <p>Boxeon takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current Boxeon Privacy Policy, please <a class='one-em-font primary-color'
                    href="/privacy">click here</a>.</p>

            <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental
                consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under
                13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if
                you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal
                information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13,
                we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have
                provided us personal information, please contact us at service@Boxeon.com.</p>

            <h2>What are the basics of using Boxeon?
            </h2>
            <p> You will be required to sign in with Google Sign In to create an account, which will programmatically grant
                us access to the relevant Google Account data to create a Boxeon account. You promise to provide us with
                accurate, complete, and updated information about yourself. You may not sign in using another person's
                Google Account that you don’t have the right to use, or use on the Services, another person’s name with the
                intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior
                written permission.</p>

            <p>You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received
                your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to
                these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you
                represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s
                behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms,
                except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).
            </p>
            <p>You will only use the Services in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the
                Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and
                won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</p>

            <p>You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account
                and your password. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.
            </p>
            <p>Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:</p>
            <p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or User Submission (each of those
                terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:
            </p>
            <p>(a) Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including
                Boxeon);</p>

            <p>(c) Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise
                objectionable;</p>

            <p>(d) Jeopardizes the security of your Boxeon account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log in
                to the Services as you);</p>

            <p>(e) Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other
                user;</p>

            <p>(f) Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;</p>

            <p>(g) Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that run
                or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper
                working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);</p>

            <p>(h) “Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content
                (through use of manual or automated means);</p>

            <p>(j) Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or
                information of or relating to the Services.</p>
  
            <p>A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.
            </p>

            <h2>What are my rights in Boxeon?</h2>
            <p>The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to,
                text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the
                foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to
                abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you
                access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast,
                transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any
                Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that
                violates someone else’s (including Boxeon’s) rights.</p>

            <p>You understand that Boxeon owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the
                transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based
                on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>

            <p>The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this
                functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!</p>

            <h2>Do I have to grant any licenses to Boxeon or to other users
            </h2>
            <p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services, such as any text,
                photographs, ideas, comments, suggestions, or other content, is your “User Submission.” Some User
                Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to
                allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions.
                Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate
                to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.
            </p>
            <p>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Boxeon a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for
                example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer), copy, distribute, display,
                publish, perform, sell transmit, create derivative works and otherwise act with respect to such User
                Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate or improve the Services, as described in more detail
                below. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected. You agree that the
                licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide. You irrevocably
                waive and agree not to assert any “moral rights,” that you have to prevent us from exploiting the rights
                granted above.</p>

            <p>You also grant us the right to use and display your name, Boxeon User ID, photograph, and any other
                information that you submit in connection with any Boxeon User ID.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, you understand and agree that Boxeon, in performing the required technical steps to provide the
                Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and
                adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or
                media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.</p>

            <h2>What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright</h2>
            <p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service
                providers, like Boxeon, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We
                respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged
                to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to review our complete
                Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, click here. To learn more
                about the DMCA, click here.</p>

            <h2>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services</h2>
            <p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole
                responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and
                content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or
                for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take
                any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of
                having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or
                not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you
                interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>

            <p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and
                warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all
                your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection
                with the Services.
            </p>
            <p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or
                controlled by Boxeon. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that
                there are risks in doing so, and that Boxeon is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware
                when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party
                website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>

            <p>Boxeon has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or
                practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with
                through the Services. In addition, Boxeon will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of
                any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all
                liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.</p>

            <p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment
                and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated
                with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make
                whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline
                transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Boxeon shall not be responsible or liable for
                any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>

            <p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that
                Boxeon is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more
                other users, you release Boxeon, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and
                damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed,
                arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident,
                you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not
                extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
                executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement
                with the debtor."
            </p>
            <h2>How do Boxeon memberships work?
            </h2>
            <p>Boxeon offers subscription membership plans (“Membership(s)”) pursuant to which you will receive regular
                shipments of socially conscious, specially curated lifestyle and other products. We offer multiple payment
                plans for Memberships; for example, we may offer a quarterly or annual payment plan. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
                AGREE THAT YOUR MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW UNLESS YOU CANCEL IT OR WE SUSPEND OR TERMINATE YOUR
                MEMBERSHIP/ACCOUNT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS. You understand that we will automatically charge your
                credit card on file for each applicable billing period (depending on which payment plan you’ve selected)
                until you cancel your Membership.
            </p>
            <p>You may cancel your Membership at any time by contacting us at service@Boxeon.com. or by logging into your
                account, scrolling down the the subscriptions dashboard, and clicking ‘cancel’ on the right side of the
                subscription you would like to terminate. Cancellation requests must be received prior to the billing date
                of the Membership renewal, or else you will be charged for the then-current billing period.</p>

            <p>Boxeon may, from time to time in its sole discretion, offer certain promotional codes for discounts and other
                benefits. You may not transfer promotional codes or redeem them for cash, credit, or toward previous
                purchases. Furthermore, you may not use promotional codes in conjunction with any other offer or promotional
                discount, and you must redeem promotional codes by the date published, if provided. Lost promotional codes
                cannot be replaced. You may only use one promotional code. Any promotional program may be terminated or
                modified by Boxeon at any time in its sole discretion. Promotional codes are void where prohibited.</p>

            <h2>What terms govern my purchase of Memberships and other products through the Services?</h2>
            <p>While we will try to give you advance notice of any changes in our pricing and availability, we reserve the
                right to change our prices, available products, and Memberships at any time. Also, we may occasionally make
                errors in the stated prices on the Services. If a product’s or Membership’s correct price is inaccurately
                stated on the Services, we will, in our discretion, either confirm the correct price with you or cancel your
                order and notify you of such cancellation.</p>

            <p>All sales are final and we do not allow returns or substitutions of products. We reserve the right to refuse
                or limit any orders and Memberships. We may refuse any cancellation requests for products and orders in our
                sole discretion. We reserve the right to provide substantially similar products to fulfill your order.
            </p>
            <p>If you receive a damaged or incomplete order, please contact us at service@Boxeon.com within three [3] weeks of
                receiving your order. We may offer any refunds or replacements solely in our discretion.
            </p>
            <p>We are no longer responsible for damage to your order or risk of loss once we deliver your order to the
                common carrier for shipment to you. Title to your order passes from us to you at the time we deliver your
                order to the common carrier. We reserve the right to choose any common carrier to ship your order to you. We
                may not be able to have your order shipped to a post office box, to certain addresses or on certain days. We
                reserve the right to ship your order in multiple boxes or shipments.</p>

            <p>You authorize Boxeon and its payment processor to charge your payment card for all purchases/subscriptions
                you make, including automatically during each billing period for your Membership. You are responsible for
                providing us with complete and accurate personal and payment account information, and for keeping such
                information up-to-date. We may, in our sole discretion, cancel your payment at any time by providing notice
                to you through the contact information you have provided us in your account (such as your personal email
                address) or by a notice when you attempt to make a payment. We may cancel a payment or prevent you from
                making future payments for any reason, including, without limitation, (a) if you attempt to use the Services
                in breach of any applicable law or regulation; (b) if we suspect fraudulent, unlawful or improper activity
                regarding a payment; or (c) if you breach any of these Terms of Use or our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>Our pricing does not include any customs duties, sales, use, value-added, excise, federal, state, local or
                other taxes. You are solely responsible for the payment of such taxes related to your purchase. We have the
                right to charge you for any taxes that we believe we are required to pay or collect related to your
                purchase.</p>

            <h2>Will Boxeon ever change the Services?</h2>
            <p>We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any
                part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict
                access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the
                Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right
                to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if
                someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and
                without notice.
            </p>
            <h2>SMS, MMS, and other text messaging communications</h2>
            <p>Some of our services may allow you to receive SMS, MMS or other text message notifications from us (each, a
                “Text Message”). To the extent you voluntarily opt to have Text Messages from us sent directly to your
                mobile phone (in each instance, as applicable, the "Text Program"), the following additional terms apply:
            </p>
            <p>You agree (i) to receive recurring automated marketing Text Messages from us about our digital and physical
                products, services and/or events that we think may be of interest to you at the phone number you provided,
                and that the messages may be sent via automatic telephone dialing system or other technology and (ii) to use
                and participate in the Text Program subject to Boxeon’s Terms of Use and Boxeon’s Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>Message frequency is recurring. Consent is not a condition of purchase. Reply STOP to opt-out and HELP for
                more information, including customer support. You understand and agree that attempting to opt-out by any
                means other than texting the opt-out commands above, or requesting via email to service@Boxeon.com to be

                such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact
                information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or
                reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).

            <p>Assignment. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or
                your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Boxeon’s prior written consent.
                We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>

            <p>Choice of Law; Arbitration. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of
                New York, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating
                to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in Kings County, New York, in English,
                in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
                Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in
                resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate
                list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator
                may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate
                disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from
                any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive
                jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in Kings County,
                New York. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an
                individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY
                ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Boxeon ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A
                CLASS ACTION.</p>

                other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that
                Boxeon may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.
                The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of
                any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that
                provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall
                otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Boxeon agree that these Terms are the
                complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Boxeon, and that it supersedes
                and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to
                the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent,
                partner, or joint venture of Boxeon, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Boxeon in any
                respect whatsoever. You and Boxeon agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
