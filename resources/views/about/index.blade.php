		<p> <span class="highlighted">We're</span> an international group with an acute desire to make globalization work for the many, not only a few. To satisfy this desire, we've created Boxeon. Our goal is to create mutually beneficial relationships between <span class="highlighted">creators and artisans</span> in developing countries. We achieve this with the Boxeon Partner Program, which enlists artisans as suppliers of products for the subscription boxes offered by partner creators.</p>
