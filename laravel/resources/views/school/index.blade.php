            <h2>Why have a subscription?</h2>
            <p>According to the Time Use Institute, we spend more than 53 hours each year
                just grocery shopping. A Boxeon grocery subscription saves you this precious time so you can take
                back control of your busy schedule - which will inevitably lead to more free time for yourself and
                loved ones.</p>

            <h2> How does it work?</h2>
            <p> Set up regularly scheduled deliveries and earn savings. We'll ship your African groceries to you nationwide so; you no longer have to go hunting for them. You may cancel or pause a delivery at any time.</p>
