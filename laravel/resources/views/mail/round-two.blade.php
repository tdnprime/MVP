# Congrats {{$user->given_name}}!

Your application made it to Round Two of our selection process.


We've perused your social and concluded you're a great candidate 
for our Partnership Program. In the following round, the competition will 
be much stiffer, however. We'll be emailing you within a week to inform you 
if you've made it to Round Three.

Until then, please give some thought as to what your subscription box would entail
in terms of theme and products. This will give you a headstart on preparing for a
possible interview with us if you're selected for Round Three.

Sincerely,<br>
