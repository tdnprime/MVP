            <p> <span class="highlighted">We're</span> an international group with an acute desire to make globalization
                work for the many, not only a few. To satisfy this desire, we've created Boxeon. Our goal is to create
                mutually beneficial relationships between <span class="highlighted">creators and artisans</span> in
                developing countries. We achieve this with the Boxeon Partner Program, which enlists artisans as suppliers
                of products for the subscription boxes offered by partner creators. We strive to make these relationships a
                win for the artisans, and creators and the fans who love them.</p>
            <p> <span class="highlighted">But</span> Boxeon's benefit extends to creators and their fans without them
                being part of our partner program. If you think about it, you too will conclude that the subscription box
                model is the ideal way for creators and fans to become closer in a tangible way. </p>

            <p><span class="highlighted">Our workdays</span> consist of jumping over hurdles so that you don't have to.
                Unlike other platforms, we have no hidden fees and will not micromanage or have sudden freakouts.</p>

            <p><span class="highlighted">We're professionals</span> drawn from Google, Microsoft, the United Nations, and
                many more. Our professional expertise includes software engineering, shipping logistics, product curation,
                and marketing. In other words, we're the right people to get this job done.</p>
            <p><span class="highlighted">Our founders</span> met on Reddit and have remained in touch for over three years
                before Boxeon was born. They believe in compassionate capitalism. Plus, they're cool people so feel free to
                say hello to them on LinkedIn:</p>
