Hi {{$user->given_name}}!

Your Boxeon is almost ready.

Please add our email to your contacts to avoid missing important updates.

For your Boxeon to go live, sign in to your account, click on your user icon on the top right-hand corner of the site, and embed a YouTube video. 

Embed the YouTube video by copying its URL from the browser and pasting it into the embed form.

<h2>Here are some tips for creating the video you will embed:</h2>

- Keep it short.
- Succinctly - give the necessary information fans need to make an informed decision.  
- Inform fans that they can schedule a monthly, bi-monthly, or tri-monthly subscription - they can get in where their finances allow.  
- End the video with a call to action.


<h2>Here are some things that you need to know as a creator:</h2>

- <b class="primary-color">Shipping</b> - You'll receive an email (and possibly other forms of notifications) when boxes need to be shipped. If we're not doing your fulfillment, go to the Labels page and print your shipping labels or retrieve your subscribers' mailing addresses. 

- <b class="primary-color">Account settings</b> - You may update your Boxeon on the Account page of the website. 

- <b class="primary-color">Boxeon Partnership Program</b> - If you're a creator with lots of fans, you might need help with sourcing, logistics, and fulfillment. If this is the case, reach out to us, as we have a program designed just for you.

- <b class="primary-color">Payouts</b> - Boxeon processes payouts on the 1st of every month. We recommend waiting until the 5th of the month to pay out your balance – this will allow for any retries of declined payments.

- <b class="primary-color">Bank accounts</b> - Sellers must have a bank account to receive payouts. You will soon receive an email from us with instructions on how to submit your bank account information.

- <b class="primary-color">Customer service</b> - You're responsible for your customer service. Your paying subscribers will be able to send your messages on Boxeon. Please check your Boxeon messages often. 

- <b class="primary-color">Feedback</b> - We welcome your feedback, ideas, and opinions. Please fill out our feedback form at your earliest convenience.

That's it.

Now, go make that video!
